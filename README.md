# Basic Statistics for Data Analysis

1.	Descriptive Statistics
    - Mean, median, mode
    - Variance and standard deviation
    - Percentiles and quartiles
    - Data visualization
2.	Inferential Statistics
    - Confidence intervals
    - Hypothesis testing (A/B testing, t-tests, chi-square tests, z-tests, etc.)
    - Correlation and covariance
3.	Linear Regression
4.	Classification
5.	Probability Basics
    - Basic probability rules
    - Distributions (normal, uniform, binomial)
    - Sampling techniques

**Histogram**: a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset showing the frequency of data points in specified intervals.

**Box plot**: a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset showing the median, quartiles, and possible outliers.

**Linear Regression**: a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent varaibles.

**R-squared**: measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.


**Adjusted R-squared**: adjusts for the number of independent varaibles in the model.
