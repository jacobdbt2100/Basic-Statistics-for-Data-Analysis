# Basic Statistics for Data Analysis

**Histogram**: a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset showing the frequency of data points in specified intervals.

**Box plot**: a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset showing the median, quartiles, and possible outliers.

**Linear Regression**: a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent varaibles.

**R-squared**: measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.

**Adjusted R-squared**: adjusts for the number of independent varaibles in the model.
